	Fit Generalized Linear Mixed Models
}
\description{
	glmmGS is used to fit generalized mixed linear models specified by a string-like formula.
	The MLE estimation of the parameters is performed by using a Gauss-Seidel algorithm 
	to fit the regression coefficients (see Reference), and a Penalized Quasi Likelihood (PQL) 
	approach to fit the covariance components (see Note). The algorithm is highly optimized to fit 
	fixed effect models to data-sets with a large number of observations and 
	with stratified covariates with a large number of levels, and mixed models 
	with stratified covariates with a large number of levels and diagonal
	covariance structures. Covariance structures defined by non diagonal dense 
	or sparse precision matrices are also allowed (see \code{\link{glmmGS.CovarianceModel}}).
}
\usage{
	glmmGS(formula, family, data = NULL, covariance.models = NULL, control = glmmGS.Control())
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
	\item{formula}{
		a formula object providing a symbolic description of the model to be fitted.
		The formula object must be of the type \emph{response ~ linear-predictor}. For a binomial
		response, the response must be defined as \code{(outcome | counts)}. The linear predictor 
		comprises fixed effects and random effects. Fixed and random effects must be grouped 
		in blocks (the blocks of the Gauss-Seidel algorithm, see Reference) 
		specified by pairs of parentheses. Blocks of covariates can be stratified by a grouping
		variable. The covariance model inside the random effect block is specified by using the symbol 
		\code{~} followed by a variable-name of a previously defined \code{\link{glmmGS.CovarianceModel}}).
		If an offset \code{off} is present in the linear predictor, it must be specified with keyword
		\code{offset(off)} before the specification of the fixed and random effects. The intercepts should
		always be explicitly specified by the symbol \code{1}; implicit specification
		of the intercept is not assumed. See Details for information on how non-identifiability 
		introduced by multiple intercepts is handled. 
		In order to minimize the memory usage, none of the variables present in the formula
		are copied or coerced. In particular:
		discrete outcomes must be integer vectors;
		covariates must be vectors and/or matrices of either integer or numeric (i.e., double) type; 
		grouping variables used to specify stratified covariates must be integer 
		vectors containing zero-based consecutive levels.
	}
	\item{family}{
		a description of the error distribution. Only two families are currently allowed:
		\code{binomial} and \code{poisson} with a canonical link.
	}
	\item{data}{
		an optional data frame, list or environment (or object coercible by as.data.frame 
		to a data frame) containing the variables in the model. 
		If not found in \code{data}, the variables are taken from \code{environment(formula)}, 
		typically the environment from which \code{glmmGS} is called.
	}
	\item{covariance.models}{
		an optional list or environment containing the covariance models referenced 
		in the formula. If not found in \code{covariance.models}, the covariance models are taken from 
		\code{environment(formula)}, typically the environment from which \code{glmmGS} is called.
	}
	\item{control}{
		a list of parameters for controlling the fitting process. The list is returned
		by the \code{\link{glmmGS.Control}} function.
	}
}
\details{
	%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
	If a global intercept is specified, then each stratified intercept is constrained to
	have zero mean. In all the other cases where multiple intercepts are specified, if the fitting 
	algorithm converges, then the values of the intercept are determined up to a random constant.

	%%  If it is a LIST, use
	%%  \item{comp1 }{Description of 'comp1'}
	%%  \item{comp2 }{Description of 'comp2'}

	In the current implementation (see Note), the function returns 
	a list of values comprised of:
	\item{fixed.effects}{
		a list containing the items:
		\code{estimates}: the estimates of the fixed effect coefficients;
		\code{standard.errors}: the standard errors of the fixed effect coefficient estimates
		(see Note).
	}
	\item{random.effects}{
		a list containing the items:
		\code{estimates}: the estimates of the random effect coefficients;
		\code{standard.errors}: the standard errors of the random effect coefficient estimates
		(see Note).
	}
	\item{covariance.components}{
		a list containing the items:
		\code{estimates}: the estimates of the covariance components;
		\code{standard.errors}: the standard errors of the covariance components.
	}
	\item{iterations}{
		the number of iterations.

\note{
%%  ~~further notes~~
	The distinguishing characteristic of the Gauss-Seidel algorithm is that the full
	precision matrix of the posterior distribution of the parameters
	is never computed. Only diagonal blocks of the precision matrix are computed, 
	one for each pair of parentheses in the formula. Furthermore, each precision-block
	associated with stratified covariates, is subdivided in as many sub-blocks 
	as many levels there are in the grouping factor. As a consequence, 
	the standard errors associated with the coefficient estimates are computed 
	for each block conditionally to the other blocks, and they tend to be
	smaller than the standard-errors calculated using the full posterior
	distribution of the parameters. 
	
	The \code{glmmGS} function is optimized to handle data-sets with a large number of observations 
	and data stratifications with a large number of levels. 
	To avoid unnecessary memory allocation, the return value contains only minimal fitting information.
	Auxiliary functions to calculate quantities such as	block covariance matrices, 
	fitted values, predictors, will be soon released. We strongly recommend not to commit 
	to the current format of the return value, since it will likely change in the next release. 
	A user should write \sQuote{accessor} functions to parse the return value, so that user-code 
	using \code{glmmGS} would only need to change the \sQuote{accessor} functions in the next
	release. 
	
	Although it is possible to specify as many blocks of random effects as desired, the PQL update
	of the covariance components is performed one block at a time. This yields to different
	estimates compared to a joint PQL update of the covariance components. Alternative
	approaches, more compatible with the component-wise nature of the Gauss-Seidel
	algorithm, to the PQL approximation of the integration over the random effect 
	coefficients, are under consideration.
